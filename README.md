# Mufi-Lang Ferrufi

## How do I install these Cask?

`brew install mufi-lang/ferrufi/ferrufi`

Or `brew tap mufi-lang/ferrufi` and then `brew install ferrufi`.

Once installed you may need to allow the app to run in System Preferences > Security & Privacy, this is due to not being notarized by Apple.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
